# cardboard_maze

Welcome to the stat of a simple cardboard VR Game in Unity 5

While I am learning Stange iOC, I am not attempting to use it for this project. You will see bits of MVC in the code, but atlas, Unity 5 just does not make it easy to use the traditional View as you would in other tools.
